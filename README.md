# Emotion Detection Using ResNet50V2

## Description

Developed an advanced Emotion Detection system utilizing transfer learning with ResNet50V2 to classify human emotions from facial expressions. The project leverages the FER-2013 dataset to train the model, enhancing its ability to accurately identify a range of emotional states from images.

## Key Features

- **Transfer Learning with ResNet50V2:** Utilized the pre-trained ResNet50V2 model, applying transfer learning techniques to adapt the model for emotion classification, significantly improving training efficiency and accuracy.
- **Comprehensive Dataset:** Employed the FER-2013 dataset, consisting of 35,887 labeled images of facial expressions across seven emotion categories (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral).
- **Model Training and Fine-Tuning:** Fine-tuned the ResNet50V2 model to achieve optimal performance in emotion detection, ensuring high accuracy and robustness in diverse conditions.
- **Evaluation and Validation:** Conducted thorough evaluation and validation of the model using various metrics to ensure reliable emotion classification.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- ResNet50V2
- FER-2013 Dataset
